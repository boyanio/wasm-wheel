# The Wheel of WebAssembly

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/boyanio/wasm-wheel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/boyanio/wasm-wheel)

The _Wheel of WebAssembly_ is a project aiming to show the diversity of languages that compile to WebAssembly. My initial idea was to define two functions in each language:

- `name()` - returning the name of the language. This is used to render each part of the wheel.
- `feelingLucky()` - returning a random integer between 1 and 100. This is used when the wheel is spinned.

In theory, when compiling each language, the output wasm file should be almost identical. In practice, this is not the case. As many of the compilers are still very experimental, these two functions cannot be definen in all the languages. Some have issues with generating a random number, so I import JavaSript's `Math.random()` to help them. Others cannot handle strings properly. WebAssembly defines only numeric types and strings are suppsed to be put in the linear memory and accessed via a pointer from JavaScript.

## Supported languages

- C / C++
- C#
- AssemblyScript
- Rust
- Java
- Kotlin
- Go
- PHP

## Getting started

Using Docker is the easiest way to get started. With Docker multi-stage builds for building each wheel part, the output image becomes around (only) _113MB_. Each wheel part has a Dockerfile in its folder, so they all need to be combined into one global Dockerfile before building the image.

```
$> git clone https://github.com/boyanio/wasm-wheel.git
$> cd wasm-wheel
$> npm run build:dockerfile
$> docker build . -t wasm-wheel
$> docker run -p 8080:8080 -t wasm-wheel:latest
```

## Manual installation

The basic requirement to set up the repository is Node.js. I have tested with version _8.9.1_, but other (newer) versions would probably work as well.

```
$> git clone https://github.com/boyanio/wasm-wheel.git
$> cd wasm-wheel
$> npm i
```

Furthermore, each language has additional requirements.

### Compiling wheel parts

Each wheel part represents a language that can be compiled to WebAssembly. My initial idea was to use toolchain to compile each source automatically, but this turned out to be a bit more complex. That is why I am putting here how each source can be compiled individually.

#### C / C++

Compiled by [emscripten](https://emscripten.org).

#### C#

You would either need [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/) or Visual Studio 2017+ installed on your machine to compile the source. Although Mono has an [example](http://www.mono-project.com/news/2017/08/09/hello-webassembly/) of compiling C# directly to WebAssembly, the set-up is a bit more complicated. That is why I use Steve Sanderson's initial adjustment of [DotNetAnywhere](https://github.com/boyanio/DotNetAnywhere) to interpret .NET into the browser. You would also need [emscripten](https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) >= 1.38.12 to compile DotNetAnywhere's interpretter to WebAssembly.

#### AssemblyScript

[AssemblyScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assemblyscript) defines a subset of TypeScript that can be compiled to WebAssembly. Currently using version `0.9.4` of the compiler.

#### Rust

You have to install the Rust toolchain by following these [instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html). Afterwards you need to add the wasm32 target.

```
$> rustup update
$> rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

#### Java

In order to compile Java into WebAssembly, I use [TeaVM](http://teavm.org/). The only thing you need is Maven - it will install its depedencies afterwards. You obviously need Java SDK as well.

#### Kotlin

[Kotlin/Native](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/) is used to compile Kotlin to WebAssembly. Compiling Kotlin to native restricts you from importing Java libraries. In order to generate random numbers, one may use C instead (as in the C wheel part), but this requires further configuration using the `cinterop` tool. I think it is easier just to import the JavaScript one.

As I don't need the `main` function, I tried specifying `-nomain` on the compiler, but it still throws an exception when initializing the WebAssembly module.

#### Go

[Go 1.14](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.14) ships experimental WebAssembly support. The communication from JavaScript to Go works with callbacks, which made me change all other calls to use promises. The output file is quite large so far (~ 1.5MB), but this is already being [addressed](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/6853).

#### PHP

The PHP interpreter is [compiled](https://github.com/oraoto/pib/) to WebAssembly and then using the wrapper function `pib_eval` we can evaluate PHP code, which gets printed on the console.

### Build & Run

Compilation is done via Docker. The following command will compile all sources to WASM and set up a HTTP server on port 8080. You can then access the site on `http://localhost:8080`.

```
$> npm run build
$> npm start
```

You can re-build individual wheel parts by running the following command:

```
$> npm run build:lang -- [lang]
```
